  <p>
    Skincare and makeup go hand in hand and CA Skin was something I dreamt up
    soon after CA Cosmetics. Iâ€™ve been working on this for what feels like a
    lifetime so I canâ€™t believe itâ€™s finally here! Building my makeup line from
    the ground up has taught me a lot and Iâ€™m so blessed with that knowledge to
    apply to my brand new company! Birthing a whole new team, manufacturing,
    fulfillment etc. separate from my cosmetics line was challenging but here we
    are! I got the best of the best for you guys! Everything is cruelty free,
    vegan, gluten free, paraben and sulfate free and suitable for all skin
    types. Make sure you follow @CAskin to stay updated. So much love went into
    this. It all starts with skin. xo, CA ðŸ’•
