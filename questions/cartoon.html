      <h2 class="bg-success">Akira Toriyama's first draft</h2>
      <p class="bg-info">
        When Toriyama started his first draft of Dragon Ball, he originally
        <img
          class="float-right"

        />
        planned on making Goku full monkey to make the series more faithful to
        Journey to the West. During Toriyama's second draft, Goku was instead a
        full human dressed in sailor clothes that rode a flight mecha instead of
        the Flying Nimbus.Toriyama's third draft became the final design. Goku's
        full name is also based on Sun Wukong. The name "Son Goku" is simply the
        Japanese on'yomi rendering of Sun Wukong, as Chinese and Japanese share
        the same characters but with different pronunciations. "Sun/Son" is a
        common Chinese surname that normally means "grandchild", while
        "Wukong/Goku" is a common Buddhist name that means "perceiving
        air/awakened to emptiness". Reading "Sun Wukong" via the first and final
        characters only through the Japanese kun'yomi rendering system makes it
        read out as "Mago Gosora", used at some point as a gag in the original
        manga's run by the World Tournament Announcer. Goku was revealed a month
        before the Dragon Ball manga started, in postcards sent to members of
        the Akira Toriyama Preservation Society.Goku's first appearance was on
        the last page of "Grand Finale", the last chapter of the Dr. Slump
        manga, advertising Dragon Balls upcoming debut. Goku's Saiyan birth
        name, Kakarot, is a pun on "carrot". Goku's family are all named after
        root vegetables (burdock, negi, radish, and carrot). While Goku is an
        overall good person, Akira Toriyama designed him as one who fights
        mostly for personal joy of challenging strong opponents. To which,
        Toriyama notes that the anime tends to go overboard in making Goku look
        heroic, and that his original depiction of Goku in the manga has certain
        "poisonous" traits
      </p>
      <h2 class="bg-success">Background</h2>
      <p class="bg-info">
        Goku was named Kakarot at birth. In the manga, Kakarot was born on
        Planet Vegeta three years before its destruction, while in the anime
        Goku was born shortly before the destruction of the planet. When Frieza
        destroyed Planet Vegeta, Goku survived as he was being sent to Earth.
        After landing on Earth, the young Saiyan was found in the woods by an
        old man named Gohan and became his adopted grandson. Grandpa Gohan names
        him "Son Goku".
